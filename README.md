# json_to_notices

It is a prototype to automate the creation of an excel file. The file is used in my beach volleyball club to make a notice for current events during a season.

## Usage

Under lib/mocks.dart you can add your events and they will be displayed in the excel.

Start it as a web app

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```
